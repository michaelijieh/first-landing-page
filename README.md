# first-landing-page
This is my first landing page!

This is a project based off the odin project css curriculum.
It is a one-page website consisting of four sections and a footer. 
It would also feature a header with navigation and a logo. 
the colors and fonts were predefined and the object was to replicate the final design. 
Only the images were liberally chosen and credits given below.
